        <h4 class="cook">Beef and vegetables</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">
            First of all you need to make sort of stew from your ground beef and vegetables.
            Put a dutch owen on the stowe over medium-high heat and let it heat up.
            Put your beef in the pot and let it caramelize , while it`s cooking chop up your vegetables.
            Vegetables should be cut in cubes roughly 0,5 cm thick (roughly the size of a single pea).
            When your beef is about 80% done add onions and carrots and let it cook for 5 minutes.
            Add your broth to deglaze the pan , add green peas stir well to combine.
            Add salt and pepper to taste and leave it simmer on low heat for 30-40 minutes.
        </p>
        <h4 class="cook">Mashed potatoes</h4>
        <p>
            For mashed potatoes you firstly need to peal them , then boil till soft.
            Heat 500 ml of milk until roughly 80 degrease celsius.
            Drain all the water from potatoes and start mashing it , add 3 tbsp of butter.
            Add 100 grams of parmesan to your potatoes and keep mashing it.
            Start adding milk a little bit at a time and keep stirring/mashing.
            When it is done it will be silky-like consistency.
            Add salt and pepper to taste and stir it one more time.
        </p>
        <h4 class="cook">Baking</h4>
        <p>
            At this point your dish is pretty much done , you just need to layer and bake it.
            Put your stew on the bottom of the baking sheet and the potatoes on top.
            You can rough-up mashed potatoes with fork and sprinkle with parmesan to cover it.
            Because all of the ingredients already done , it doesn`t need too much time in owen.
            Put it in the owen for 15-20 minutes under the broiler , and it is done.
